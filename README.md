**So in the end I just downloaded this [Imagenette](https://s3.amazonaws.com/fast-ai-imageclas/imagenette2-320.tgz) lol**

## Milestone
The project will start on 16 September and end on 16 January. There will be the following milestones and
deliverables:

- 14 October: prepare the data set and the model. The image data will be saved in a CSV file with the
ground truth value. Data collection, model preparation and development of the interpretable model
will proceed in parallel.
- 17 October: build the environment in Python 3.9, testbed, and implement the XAI technique (LIME)
for the next stage.
- 28 October: first approach, conduct experiments to collect useful knowledge.
- 4 November: conduct experiments with possible tutor feedback.
- 11 November: analyze and improve the experimentation for better generalization.
- 18 November: final experiments and results.
- 29 November: presentation rehearsal, submit first draft of report and presentation.
- 16 December: final presentation.
- 23 December: possible peer feedback and improvement in written report.
- 16 January: finish the final report, which will be written in parallel during the above steps.
